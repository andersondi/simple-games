# simple-games
Those simple games was written to practice python basics.
The programs contained here was used to practice the fundamentals of python as well as how to use GIT.

The idea was do a home menu that show two game options:

- Simple Games
  - Hangman
  - Guess a Number.
  
## Guess a number
This is my first program (Hello world's like don't count, ok?!).
This program is a classic one and allowed me to try somethings like:

- Functions
- Loops and conditionals
